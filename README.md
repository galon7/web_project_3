# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

**Intro**

* This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**New skills**

* In this very early project I learned how to use Figma, CSS grid, external fonts, optimize images, publish on GitHub pages and more.

**Website**
